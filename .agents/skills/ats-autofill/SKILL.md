# ATS Autofill

Fills out a job application form so the only thing left is reading it and clicking Submit.

## The one rule

**This skill never clicks Submit.** Not on Greenhouse, not on Lever, not anywhere. It fills, screenshots, reports, and stops.

Three reasons, and none of them are negotiable:

1. **Terms of Service.** Automated submission on LinkedIn, Indeed, and Dice violates their terms and risks permanent suspension of the accounts the job search itself depends on. Losing a LinkedIn account to save thirty seconds per application is a bad trade.
2. **Legal attestation.** Application forms ask about work authorization, prior employment, compensation, and EEO status. Those answers are attested statements. A human confirms them.
3. **Recoverability.** A wrong field caught before submitting costs nothing. Caught after, it costs the application, and sometimes the relationship with that employer.

If a future change makes this tool submit automatically, that change is wrong.

## Setup

```bash
cd .agents/skills/ats-autofill/cli
bun install
bunx playwright install chromium
```

Then copy the profile template and fill it in:

```bash
cp application_profile.example.json application_profile.json
```

`application_profile.json` is gitignored. It holds contact details and work-authorization answers, so it never gets committed.

Verify the setup:

```bash
cd .agents/skills/ats-autofill/cli && bun run src/cli.ts doctor
```

## Usage

**Inspect first.** See what would be filled without touching the page:

```bash
bun run src/cli.ts inspect https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/acme/jobs/1234567
```

**Then fill, with the browser visible:**

```bash
bun run src/cli.ts fill https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/acme/jobs/1234567 --headed \
  --resume ../../../../cv/main_acme.pdf \
  --cover ../../../../cover_letters/cover_acme_ai_engineer.pdf
```

With `--headed`, the browser opens, the form fills, and a review gate waits. Review every field and submit by hand. In a direct CLI session, press Enter to close the browser (stdin close cancels). When Desk launched Autofill, use Continue or Cancel on the review card instead. There is no Submit control in either adapter.

## How it decides what to fill

`src/matcher.ts` holds pure, unit-tested matching logic (`bun test`). For each form field it derives a label (aria-label, `<label for>`, ancestor label, fieldset legend, placeholder, name) and matches it against the profile.

Three behaviors worth knowing:

- **Sponsorship polarity is resolved explicitly.** "Do you require sponsorship?" and "Are you authorized to work without sponsorship?" get opposite answers from the same profile data. This is the single most dangerous class of field to auto-answer, so it is handled by a dedicated resolver with its own tests rather than by a generic keyword rule.
- **Compensation is never volunteered.** `desiredSalary` and `currentSalary` default to null and stay blank. A blank box is a better negotiating position than a number typed before you knew the range. Set the value in the profile if you want it filled, and it will be flagged for review.
- **Low confidence means unfilled.** When no rule matches confidently, the field is left alone and listed under NEEDS YOUR INPUT. The tool never invents a plausible answer to a question it does not understand.

Fields marked `<-- CHECK` in the output were filled from heuristic rules. Read those before submitting.

## What it does not do

- Does not submit, under any flag
- Does not create accounts or log in. Log in yourself first if the portal requires it, or use `--headed` and authenticate in the open browser.
- Does not defeat CAPTCHAs or bot detection. If a portal blocks automation, fill that one by hand.
- Does not answer essay questions ("Why do you want to work here?"). Those come from `/apply`, which writes them against the actual posting.

## Coverage

| ATS | Detection | Notes |
|-----|-----------|-------|
| Greenhouse | URL | Best coverage. Standard labels, native file inputs. |
| Lever | URL | Good coverage. |
| Ashby | URL | Good coverage. Some custom React widgets are skipped and reported. |
| Workday | URL | Partial. Multi-step wizards need manual navigation between steps; re-run per step. |
| Generic / company-hosted | fallback | Works when labels are semantic. Reports whatever it cannot map. |

LinkedIn Easy Apply, Indeed, and Dice are deliberately unsupported for filling. Use them to find the posting, then apply on the employer's own ATS link where one exists.
