# Job search desk

A localhost desk that talks to Claude Code in this repo. Native Chat, a Claude-only Terminal tab, and Files share one folder and one conversation. Works on **macOS, Windows, and Linux**.

## Install the app

Download **Job Search Desk** from [Releases](https://github.com/iLevyTate/ai-job-search/releases):

| OS | Installer |
| --- | --- |
| Windows | `JobSearchDesk-*-win-x64.exe` (NSIS: replace or keep the old app) or the portable `.exe` |
| macOS Apple Silicon | `JobSearchDesk-*-mac-arm64.dmg` |
| Linux | `JobSearchDesk-*-linux-x64.AppImage` |

Then:

1. Run the installer. On Windows it asks whether to replace the previous Job Search Desk or keep a copy, then adds Start Menu and Desktop shortcuts and launches the app. macOS: open the `.dmg` and drag the app to Applications. Linux: mark the AppImage executable and run it.
2. Open an existing job-search folder, or create a new copy of the public repo (downloads it; Git is optional).
3. The desk starts Claude Code as soon as it opens. If Claude Code is missing, it runs Anthropic's official installer. If you are signed out, it opens the **claude.ai** login: the same Claude Pro / Max / Team / Enterprise account you use in Chrome.
4. Optional: install [Claude in Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/claude/fcoeoabgfenejglbffodgkkbkcdhcgfn) if you want the browser extension connected later.

A second click of the shortcut focuses the window that is already running. It does not start a second desk.

macOS Gatekeeper: the release is unsigned. In Finder, right-click the app → **Open**.

The app does not replace `/setup`. After you are signed in, run **Setup** once so the repo has your profile.

## Start from a clone

From the repo root:

```bash
node gui/server.mjs
```

Same folder, terminal instead of the page:

```bash
node gui/server.mjs --cli
```

Or `bun gui/server.mjs`. Wrappers: `./gui/start.sh` (macOS / Linux) or `.\gui\start.ps1` (Windows). Add `--cli` to those too. From `gui/`: `npm start` or `npm run cli`.

Desk and Claude Code share one workspace pointer (`%APPDATA%\ai-job-search\workspace.json` on Windows, `~/Library/Application Support/ai-job-search/workspace.json` on macOS, `~/.config/ai-job-search/workspace.json` on Linux). Scrapes, CVs, applications, and tracker files stay in that repo. Launch either entry point and they keep using the same folder.

If `claude` lives somewhere unusual:

```bash
CLAUDE_BIN=/path/to/claude node gui/server.mjs
```

The desk listens on `http://127.0.0.1:8765/`. The installable app uses the same page inside its own window. Native Chat is the default surface. Terminal resumes the same Claude session after a transactional handoff. Files previews generated PDFs and text. Ctrl+K opens the command palette. In browser mode the conversation is kept in `.claude/desk/transcript.json` (ignored by git) so a restart brings it back.

Claude in Chrome is optional and off unless you set `JOB_SEARCH_CLAUDE_CHROME=1`. Without that opt-in, Claude is launched with `--no-chrome` so a missing extension cannot block a turn.

## What is on the page

- **Chat** is the conversation with Claude. Steps in the left column send the matching command; **More steps…** (Ctrl+K) lists every command.
- **Jobs** lists what Find Jobs found, best fit first, with Apply and Autofill on each row. Mark a job Interested or Ignore it; applied ones move to their own filter.
- **Applications** reads the tracker: status, deadline, the CV and cover letter (preview inline or open in their usual app), and buttons to record what happened or prepare for an interview.
- **Files** previews what Claude wrote in the current conversation.
- **Add your CV or documents** copies files into the documents folder (or drop them anywhere on the page); run Setup afterwards so Claude reads them.
- **Tools check** shows which programs the steps need on this computer (TeX for PDFs, Bun for searches, Python, the Autofill browser) and how to install each.
- The header says whether Claude **works on its own** or **asks before acting**; in the installed app, **Change** switches between the two.
- The empty chat shows a checklist (profile, CV, first search, first application) that reflects the folder's real state.
- When a long step finishes while the window is in the background, the tab title gets a dot and, if you allowed it, a desktop notification.

## How to use it

1. Sign in only if the desk reports you are signed out. Claude Code opens one claude.ai tab for that; if no tab appears, use the **Open the sign-in page** link on the same card. Install Claude Code only if it is missing.
2. Click a step in the left column. **Setup**, **Find Jobs**, **Rank**, **Interview**, and **Outcome** run as soon as you click them. **Apply** asks for one thing: the job link, or the whole posting pasted in if the site blocks links. **Autofill** asks for the application form link. **More steps…** (or Ctrl+K) lists everything else, such as Import and Upskill.
3. While Claude works the chat says what it is doing: *Thinking*, *Reading job_search_tracker.csv*, *Writing*. Stop cancels the turn. Scroll up whenever you like; a **Latest** button brings you back. When Claude has a question, a **Needs you** card lists the choices; pick one or type your own answer. When the header says **Asks before acting** (Safe mode), the same kind of card asks before a tool runs.
4. **Scrape**, then talk: "which of these are real Staff AI roles?" **Rank** when the table is too long.
5. **Autofill** fills the employer form and hands the browser to you. Review it, then click Submit yourself. Desk shows Continue and Cancel only.
6. Keep typing the way you would in Claude Code: `/rank healthcare --top 10` works in the composer, and so does a plain question. Enter sends. Shift+Enter is a new line. New chat asks before clearing the conversation.

The header shows the permission mode in plain words: **Asks before acting** (Safe) asks before tools run and fails closed; **Works on its own** (Autonomous) may bypass permissions for the selected trusted folder. Safe is a Desk permission mode; it is not Claude CLI `--safe-mode`.

**Open in Terminal** still launches Claude Code in the same folder if you want the external terminal. Close the app or Ctrl+C to stop.

## Build a release locally

```bash
cd gui
npm ci
npm run build:renderer
npm test
npm run rebuild:native
npm run dist:dir
npm run test:packaged
```

Release CI builds Windows x64, macOS arm64 (Apple Silicon), and Linux x64. It does not build Intel Mac. Each job rebuilds native modules, validates the unpacked app, then builds the installer. See `.github/workflows/desk-release.yml`.
